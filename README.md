website made with wagtail

you can access the wagtail admin via <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin">http://localhost:8000/admin</a>

there you would be able to modify / create / delete pages and events according to the model definition

First, you'll have to create an event as a ChildPage of the "The Open Source Innovation Spring" HomePage, to do so you'll have to select EventsPage type and then register the proper details of the event

Then you can edit the HomePage in order to link the event ('add an event') to it and give an brief description of it.

The structure that you can edit is still in working progress, so is this README version. 

I will update both along the improvements

I you have requests or questions please let me know
